1. Write Test Cases for the above:

We use the `pytest` framework along with FastAPI's `TestClient` for writing integration tests. The main functionalities tested include:

- Client signup and email verification
- Client login with JWT token generation
- Ops login and authentication
- File upload validation (ensuring only specific extensions are accepted)
- Proper token-based access to download links

These tests simulate API calls to ensure all endpoints behave correctly in both positive and negative scenarios. A separate SQLite test database is used for isolation during testing. The tests can be executed using `pytest test_main.py`.

2. How do you plan on deploying this to the production environment?

Deployment Plan:

- **App Server**: Use `uvicorn` with `gunicorn` for running the FastAPI application.
- **Database**: Use PostgreSQL for production or keep SQLite for lightweight use.
- **Hosting Options**:
  - **Railway** or **Render** for quick and simple deployment via GitHub integration.
  - **Docker** deployment on a VPS like EC2 or DigitalOcean.
- **Reverse Proxy**: Nginx to serve as a reverse proxy and manage SSL certificates using Let's Encrypt.
- **Dockerization**: Include a Dockerfile that defines the production image, exposing the app at port 8000.
- **Environment Variables**: Use `.env` for managing secrets and configurations.
- **Security**:
  - Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt (via `passlib`).
  - JWT tokens are used for authenticated access and are verified on each request.
  - HTTPS is enforced via Nginx and SSL certificates.
- **Monitoring**: Optional logging and error monitoring via services like Sentry.

Deployment command (example):
```
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

This setup ensures the application is secure, maintainable, and production-ready.
